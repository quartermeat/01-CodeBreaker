h1. Orlando Code Kata Challenge #1 - Codebreaker Marker

!http://img.skitch.com/20091210-pd2xqxt9u9eu5ga7uf77ngp7gf.png!

Back in 1971, a UK company produced a 2 player code-breaking puzzle game that took the world by storm. It was called Mastermind and here's how it is played.  There are two players- the code setter and the code breaker. The code setter picks 4 pegs from 6 colors and arranges them in order. The pegs are colored red, blue, yellow, green, white and orange. Any combination including duplicates is allowed eg RBWO or RRRG etc.

The code breaker has to guess what the color and order of the pegs are. The guess is marked by the code maker who provides a red for every peg of the right color in the right place, and a white for a correct color in the wrong place. The code breaker keeps guessing until they guess correctly or hasn't guessed it in 10 guesses. In the challenge your application gets 15 guesses.

Your mission is to write an application will properly give markers for a guess.  So

Given we have 6 colors.
r - Red
y - Yellow
g - Green
c - Cyan
p - Purple
o - Orange

And Two markers
m - Right color, wrong place
p - Right color, right place

Given the Secret is:  r y g b
And the Guess is:     b g c c
Your app should mark: ['m', 'm'] – two colors right, but in the wrong place

Secret: r y g b
Guess:  r b c y
Mark: ['p', 'm', 'm'] – one color in right place (r), and two colors right, but wrong place (b, y)

Also see "here":http://www.trazoi.net/flash/games/CodeBreaker.html for a flash game (although ours will only have 4 rows, not 6)

I recommend starting out small, and doing test driven development.

0 matches should return [] 
   - Given secret of "r y g b", and guess of "c c c c", should return []
   
1 non-positional match should return ["m"]
   - Given secret of "r y g b", and guess of "b c c c", should return ['m']

2 non-positional matches should return ["m", "m"]
   - Given secret of "r y g b", and guess of "b g c c", should return ['m', 'm']

1 positional match should return ["p"]
   - Given secret of "r y g b", and guess of "r c c c", should return ['p']
